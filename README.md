# Network Labs

This repository contains hands-on networking labs built in Cisco Packet Tracer.

The focus is on:
- Traffic flow understanding
- OSI-layer reasoning
- Failure analysis and troubleshooting
- Observable network behavior

Each lab is designed to mirror how Network concepts appear in real environments.

## Structure

Each lab includes:
- A Packet Tracer (.pkt) file
- A written lab guide (README)
- Topology diagrams
- Failure observations and lessons learned

## Tools

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Markdown documentation
- GitHub for versioned lab tracking

This repository prioritizes comprehension over configuration and vendor-specific command knowledge.
